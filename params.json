{"name":"Demigods","tagline":"The official Demigods RPG experience for survival/PvP Minecraft servers.","body":"![Demigods Logo](http://www.demigodsrpg.com/demigods_logo.png)\r\n\r\nOverview [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CensoredSoftware/Minecraft-Demigods.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CensoredSoftware/Minecraft-Demigods)\r\n========\r\n\r\nThis is the GitHub page for **Demigods**, a full RPG experience designed to create a unique team-building game for survival/PvP servers.\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with other RPG plugins that focus on skills and classes alone- this adds culture and conflict that will keep players coming back after they've maxed out their other levels and found all the diamond deposits in a 50 km radius. Demigods is unique in its system of rewarding players for both adventuring (tributes) and conquering (PvP) with a wide array of fun and useful skills. Re-enact mythological battles and rise from a Demigod to a fully fledged Olympian as you ally yourself with the Gods, Titans, and other alliances in the battle to the bitter end!\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo install, simply place the Demigods.jar in to your plugins folder and run the server. That's it. Everything else is handled automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo contribute to Demigods, read [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n==========\r\n\r\nDemigods 3 is being developed by The Demigods Team, defined in [**AUTHORS.md**](AUTHORS.md).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
